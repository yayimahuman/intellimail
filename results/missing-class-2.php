<p id="homepage-result">Dear
<?php echo $_GET["recipient"]; ?>,

<br>
I hope your <span class="day"></span> is going well! I just wanted to inform you that, unfortunately, I will be unable to attend class on
<?php echo $_GET["day"]; ?> because of
<?php echo $_GET["reason"]; ?>. I will
<?php echo $_GET["actions"]; ?> ask a classmate for the homework and complete any work I miss. If you would like me to pick up any handouts, please let me know.
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
